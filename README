== Welcome to Textoteca

Textoteca is a word from portuguese that literally mean a "library of texts". It is a software originally developed in php for the website http://www.textoteca.com.br , for a undergrad assignment of Silvia Kist . After a few year, during the building of a new version and porting to Rails, textoteca was transformed into a general repository of simple documents.
